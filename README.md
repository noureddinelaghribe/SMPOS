### MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)

SMPOS follows the **MVVM** architectural pattern for better organization and maintainability:

- **Model:** Represents business data and logic, including Room database entities for products, customers, suppliers, and transactions.

- **View:** User interface components including activities and fragments for different sections of the application.

- **ViewModel:** Acts as a bridge between Model and View, handling business logic and preparing data for display. Manages communication with databases and services.

This architecture ensures code separation, better testability, and easier maintenance.
